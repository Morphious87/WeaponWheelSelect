This mod replaces the game's clunky weapon select with a more robust interface, displaying all weapons at once.
Use either your mouse or left joystick to choose the gun you want to equip, then let go of the gun menu button to confirm the selection.

**Why?**
Having to scroll through each gun individually can get tedious, especially the more guns you have. 
This aims to remedy that issue entirely.
